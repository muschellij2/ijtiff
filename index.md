# ijtiff <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height=140/>

This is a general purpose TIFF I/O utility for R. The [`tiff`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tiff) already exists but
`ijtiff` adds some functionality and overcomes some bugs therein.

  - `ijtiff` can write TIFF files whose pixel values are real
    (floating-point) numbers; `tiff` cannot.
  - `ijtiff` can read and write *text images*; `tiff` cannot.
  - `tiff` struggles to interpret channel information and gives cryptic
    errors when reading TIFF files written by the *ImageJ* software;
    `ijtiff` works smoothly with these images.

The github repo of `ijtiff` is at <https://github.com/ropensci/ijtiff>.
