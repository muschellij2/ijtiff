# ijtiff <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height=140/>

This is a general purpose TIFF I/O utility for R. The [`tiff` package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tiff) already exists for this purpose but `ijtiff` adds some functionality and overcomes some bugs therein. 

* `ijtiff` can write TIFF files whose pixel values are real (floating-point) numbers; `tiff` cannot. 
* `ijtiff` can read and write _text images_; `tiff` cannot.
* `tiff` struggles to interpret channel information and gives cryptic errors when reading TIFF files written by the _ImageJ_ software; `ijtiff` works smoothly with these images.

The github repo of `ijtiff` is at https://github.com/ropensci/ijtiff.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `ijtiff` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ijtiff) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ijtiff")
```

You can install the released version of `ijtiff` from [GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/ijtiff) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropensci/ijtiff")
```


## How to use `ijtiff`

The [Reading and Writing Images](https://ropensci.github.io/ijtiff/articles/reading-and-writing-images.html) article is probably all you need to know.


## More about `ijtiff`

* [Text Images](https://ropensci.github.io/ijtiff/articles/text-images.html) tells you more about what _text images_ are and why you might ever use them.
* [The _ImageJ_ Problem](https://ropensci.github.io/ijtiff/articles/the-imagej-problem.html) explains the problem that `tiff` has when reading TIFF files written by _ImageJ_ and how `ijtiff` fixes this problem.
